                    <h1> Camera L-Bracket </h1>
                    <h2 class="subtitle"> (May 2024) </h2>
    
                    <h3> Design </h3>
                        <p> I wanted to design a custom L-Bracket that could mount my DSLR in vertical and horizontal orientations on a tripod.
                            The wide slots in the bracket make it not only lightweight, but also provide access to battery and microphone ports on the DSLR.
                            I chose to make the brackets from aluminum, because I wanted them to last a long time, without the dovetail grooves deforming
                            (as would be the case with a 3D print). Initially, I thought machining the entire bracket as one piece
                            would require more setups than machining two parts and assembling them. However, in hindsight, the former would have required
                            less probing operations, reducing manufacturing time.                         
                        </p>
                    
                    <h3> Prototyping </h3>
                    <p> In order to minimize the brackets' wall thickness for reducing mass, I had to make the dovetail grooves shallower than conventional designs. To test if these
                        grooves firmly clamp the camera to the tripod, I made a 3D printed prototype. The groove depth worked well, and I adjusted the bottom bracket's
                        thickness to allow a 1/4" screw to fully thread into the camera for maximizing clamping force. Additionally, I made the slot on the 
                        side bracket longer to allow for easy access of the DSLR's side ports.                    
                    </p>

                    <h3> CNC Machining </h3>
                    <p> For manufacturing the brackets, I roughed out the slots and drilled the attachment holes. Additionally, I used a dovetail cutter for the first time
                        to create the dovetail grooves. I calculated the feeds and speeds based on a suggested feed per tooth given by the tool vendor.                 
                    </p>

                    <h3> Assembly </h3>
                    <p> Talk about reason for screw locking at half-turn. My reasoning is one of the threads might not have fully formed.                  
                    </p>-->
