                    <h1> Camera L-Bracket </h1>
                    <h2 class="subtitle"> (May 2024) </h2>
    
                    <h3> Design </h3>
                        <p> I wanted to design a custom L-Bracket that would mount my DSLR in vertical and horizontal orientations on a tripod.
                            The wide slots in the bracket make it not only lightweight, but also provide access to battery and microphone ports on the DSLR.
                            I chose to make the brackets from aluminum, because I wanted to have them last a long time, without deformation of the groove geometry
                            (which would be more likely with a 3D print). Initially, with preliminary CAM, I thought machining the entire bracket as one piece
                            would require more setups than machining two parts and assembling them. However, in hindsight, the former would have required
                            less probing operations, reducing manufacturing time.                         
                        </p>
                    
                    <h3> Prototyping </h3>
                    <p> In order to minimize brackets' wall thickness, I had to make the dovetail grooves shallower than conventional designs. To test if these
                        grooves firmly clamp to the tripod, I made a 3D printed prototype. The dovetail grooves worked well, and I adjusted the bottom bracket's
                        thickness to allow the 1/4" screw to fully thread into the camera for maximizing clamping force. Additionally, I made the slot on the 
                        side bracket longer to allow for easy access of the DSLR's side ports.                    
                    </p>

                    <h3> CNC Machining </h3>
                    <p> For the two brackets, I milled out the slots and drilled the attachment holes. This was my first time using the a dovetail endmill, where
                        I calculated the feeds and speeds based on the tool vendor's suggested feed per tooth.                  
                    </p>
