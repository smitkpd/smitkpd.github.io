                    <h3> Flutter Analysis </h3>
                        <p> During initial design of my rocket team's fins, I investigated flutter to prevent structural failure due to resonance
                            during flight. I started by referencing NACA TN 4197 and NACA Report 685, to understand underlying factors leading to flutter.
                            I wanted to design a sandwich composite structure (to reduce mass), hence the analysis was more challenging compared to that for a linear, homogenous material 
                            (such as aluminum fins). Following was my approach:-

                            <ul class="bullet-points">
                                <li> <p> &#x2022; Create FEM <i> (Finite Element Model) </i> of the composite fin in ANSYS using Composite PrepPost (ACP) </p> </li>
                                <li> <p> &#x2022; Obtain natural frequencies and mode shapes through a Modal analysis (without applying external loads) </p> </li>
                                <li> <p> &#x2022; Using the Strouhal number correlation (which relates velocity to an oscillating flowâ€™s frequency) -> adjust natural frequencies through stiffness changes
                                    (by changing carbon fiber ply count and orientation) </p> </li>
                            </ul>

                        <p> After consulting more experienced team members and engineers in industry, I learned that simplifying the analysis by using a representative beam model for the fin 
                            (with similar material properties) and correlating natural frequencies to a PSD <i> (Power Spectral Density) </i> curve would be a better way to do this. Although, I ended up 
                            changing to aluminum fins in the detailed design phase (due to greater mass savings in other parts of lower airframe), I gained a sense of how to simplify the 
                            flutter problem to not fall into the trap of analysis paralysis. </p>

                    <h3> Fin Double-Wedge Airfoil analysis </h3>
                        <p> To determine the optimal double-wedge airfoil shape for my rocket team's fins, I wrote a script to calculate drag across a supersonic double-wedge airfoil.
                            I used the compressible flow equations for oblique and expansion shocks, to calculate the pressure ratio at each station. Drag can be derived
                            from these pressure ratios. Additionally, I modeled a 2D double-wedge airfoil in CFD using ANSYS FLUENT to determine the drag coefficient, and validate
                            with hand calculations.
                        </p>
                    
                    <h3> FEA Mesh Convergence </h3>  
                    <p> For the FEM of upper airframe struts, I improved the mesh and bolt contact modeling, as well as conducted a mesh convergence study.
                        Sharp transitions of tetrahedral mesh elements at the bolt holes led to unrealistically high stresses, giving a Safety Margin less than zero. To resolve this,
                        I refined the mesh around bolt holes using a Sphere of Influence control, used non-linear material properties, and experimented with different bolt
                        diameters and strut flange thicknesses.
                    </p>
