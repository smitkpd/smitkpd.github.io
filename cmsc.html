                    <h1> Heating Coil Experiment </h1>
                    <h2 class="subtitle"> (May 2024 - Present) </h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        At the Composites Manufacturing and Simulation Center (CMSC), I am working on embedding heating coils between layers of 3D printed tooling (for
                        composite parts) to provide localized heating in different regions of the tooling. This is required for curing a part with varying thickness 
                        and thermal conductivity.

                        Specifically, I am responsible for characterizing filament temperature based on how much a heating coil is stretched. The following describes
                        my approach to this problem:-
                        
                        <ul class="bullet-points">
                            <li> <p> &#x2022; The filament temperature is proportional to the power dissipated by the coil -> related to coil's resistance -> 
                                proportional to the equivalent straight length of the coil. To account for springback in the coil when stretched, I related the
                                applied strain to plastic strain through hand calculations for coil deflection, based on Castigliano's theorem. Next, I computed
                                the resistance for a reference section, based on its new pitch and straight wire length.

                                To validate my calculations, I experimentally measured the final coil length after stretching it to a certain length. Additionally,
                                I measured resistance using a multimeter. Fig. 2 shows that the experimental results followed the prediction quite well.

                            <li> <p> &#x2022; Currently, I am validating the prediction for the coil's surface temperature with experimental results. I am computing
                                the coil temperature using a 1D, steady-state heat transfer analysis, with convection and radiation. To measure the coil's temperature,
                                I connected the coil to a variable power supply, and measured temperature using a thermal camera. I used Python to determine a median
                                temperature, to avoid bias from hotspots in the coil.                          
                                </p> </li>
