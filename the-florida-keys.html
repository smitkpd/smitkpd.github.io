                <p> One of the key attributes of the Florida Keys is the vibrant, clear ocean water. To highlight this, I virtually planned aerial
                    compositions with Google Earth, the day before getting on the road. I wanted to capture this island due to the winding road which leads
                    the viewer's eye into the surrounding water. The overcast sky emphasized the green and yellow hues in the water. This is in contrast to the right 
                    photograph, where the sunlit boats stand out against the coastal water.

                <p> My motivation behind the left photograph was to capture the calmness and warmth of the waves splashing againt the shore.
                    The sunset colors at the top right corner, along with the teal hue create this warm feeling. For the photo on the right, the urban lights 
                    contrasted with the deep blue appearance of the water (at dawn) creating a vibrant environment. The boat
                    trails further compliment this vibrancy and complete the composition.

                <p> I love how an aerial perspective makes vehicles look like toy cars on the road. In the left photograph, I wanted to highlight the shadows of the
                    trees and the little patch of coastal land below the road. For the right photograph, I was in awe of the huge span of the Seven Mile Bridge, and chose
                    a black and white format to convey this.
