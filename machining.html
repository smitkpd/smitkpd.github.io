                    <h1> Parts for Purdue Space Program's Liquid Rocket </h1>
                    <h2 class="subtitle"> (Jan 2024 - Present) </h2>

                    <h3> Introduction </h3>
                    <p> In Feb 2024, I became a <i> Manufacturing Teaching Assistant </i> at Purdue's BIDC. In this role, I consult students on CAM
                        and operating HAAS 3 and 5-Axis CNC mills and lathes for manufacturing parts. This page describes the challenges and lessons learned 
                        from making parts for Purdue Space Program's Liquid Rocket team.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3> Raceway Elbow Connector </h3>
                    <p> I created CAM and CNC machined a raceway elbow connector on a 5-Axis CNC mill. This part bolts to the lower tank bulkhead and houses one end of the raceway.
                        A challenging part of the machining process was determining the approach to clamping the part, since only
                        one side had flat surfaces on opposite sides. I chose to machine the portion with the flat faces first (to use them as clamping surfaces later).
                        However, I realized that milling out the slot would cause the part to deform under the clamping force of the vice. So, the slot
                        was machined in the very end. <br> <br>
                        
                        For the angled bolt holes, I first bored out holes with the stock oriented at an angle to the endmill, then drilled the holes.
                        This was to prevent the drill tip from deflecting/getting damaged, as the drill tip wouldn't be perpendicular to the stock.
                        Moreover, I had to get creative with making sketches in CAD, to select specific contours for generating toolpaths in CAM. Lastly, upon feedback 
                        from a teammate, I designed an Aluminum support structure that would be clamped in the vice, for milling out a slot.

                    <h3> Launch Lugs </h3>
                    <p>
                        This was the first part where I operated a HAAS 3-Axis CNC mill entirely independently after getting trained. I machined the launch lugs
                        in two operations, one half at a time, due to tool length limitations. For my first attempt, I probed off the stock (unreliable
                        reference surface), leading to misalignment between the two halves. On my second attempt, I aligned the part with the vice's edge and probed
                        off the vice edge - which singificantly reduced feature misalignment. Major takeaway here was to always probe off a machined or precision 
                        surface for aligning features between operations.

                    <h3> Valve Actuator Side Panels </h3>
                    <p>
                        These are side panels that are part of a larger assembly for a valve actuator. The hole in the middle required a locational interference
                        fit with a bearing sleeve. To achieve this tolerance, I first bored out majority of the hole and then ran multiple contour passes. Between each
                        contour pass, I measured the hole's inner diameter with a precision micrometer and adjusted the tool diameter offset in machine settings. <br> <br>

                        Additionally, for facing the stock on the bottom, I had to clamp the part in Kurt Vice. Since the final part's thickness was small, it bowed up
                        easily upon applying clamping force, thus I was unable to seat the parallels on both sides. I learned that its only important to seat the parallel
                        at the fixed jaw, and that reducing the clamping force allowed the part to sit flush with this parallel. Due to low clamping force, I reduced the
                        axial depth of cut of the milling operation to reduce cutting forces, thus lower the chances of the part ripping off the vice.

                    <h3> LEGO Brick </h3>
                    <p> I CNC machined a LEGO brick, as part of PSP's manufacturing training. This has some semi-complex features to program CAM toolpaths for, such
                        as a helix entry for milling out the inside and a finishing pass for getting a good surface finish.
                    </p>

                    <h3> Titan 9M </h3>
                    <p> This is a part I made to complete training for <i> >Manufacturing Teaching Assistant </i> at BIDC. I learned how to machine curved surfaces with a ball endmill,
                        making counterbores and how to improve surface finish by reducing tool's radial depth of cut. I was quite happy with the final result!
                    </p>

                    <h3> Steel screw </h3>
                    <p> As part of the CNC Lathe training, I made a steel screw. This involved facing and roughing the outside profile, grooving the slots, and threading.
                        I learned how to secure the stock in a three jaw chuck in the lathe, set up tools and probe them.
