                <p> Hello! I am Smit Kapadia, a rising junior in Aerospace Engineering at Purdue University! This website features my engineering projects
                    and photography. <br> <br>
                    
                    I am driven by a strong desire to learn how things work (aka curiosity) and a love for processes which involve
                    attention to detail, hardwork and creative perspectives. From learning how aircraft wings work to performing structural analyses of components,
                    and building things, I have come to appreciate the diverse set of problems which call for varying skill-sets in Aerospace Engineering. Outside of
                    school and my technical team, I am deeply committed to expressing the beauty of nature through my photographs, by experimenting with various
                    compositions and lighting conditions! <br> <br>
