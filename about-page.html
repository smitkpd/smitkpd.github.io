                    <p> Hello! I am Smit Kapadia, a rising junior in Aerospace Engineering at Purdue University! On this website, I will be documenting my engineering projects
                        and showcasing my landscape photography. <br> <br>
                        
                        I am driven by a strong desire to learn how things work <b> <span style="color: blanchedalmond"> (curosity) </span> </b> and a love for processes which involve
                        attention to detail, a creative perspective and hardwork. From learning how aircraft wings work to performing structural analyses of components,
                        and building things, I have come to appreciate the diverse set of problems which I can explore and engage with, in Aerospace Engineering. <br> <br>
                        
                        Outside of school and engineering projects, I develop my <b> <span style="color: blanchedalmond"> creative skills </span> </b>  through landscape photography by experimenting with various camera angles,
                        camera settings (exposure, aperture, etc.), lighting conditions, and photo editing techniques to convey my perspective on natural scenes (mountains, waterfalls, etc.) Recently, I have been exploring aerial
                        photography with a drone to capture vast landscape and urban settings!
                        <br> <br>
