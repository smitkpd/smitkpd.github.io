                    <p> Hi! I am Smit Kapadia, a junior in Aerospace Engineering at Purdue University! On this website, I will be documenting my engineering projects
                        and showcasing my landscape photography. <br> <br>
                        
                        I am driven by an urge to create things, from physical builds to writing code. I am passionate about developing things from scratch, constantly
                        learning and applying new skills in design, analysis, manufacturing and testing. I follow a mindset of attention to detail,
                        creativity in approaching problems and persistency to achieve results. <br> <br>
                        
                        Outside of school and engineering projects, I develop my creative skills through landscape photography by experimenting with various camera angles,
                        lighting conditions, and photo editing techniques to convey my perspective on natural scenes (mountains, waterfalls, etc.) Recently, I have been exploring aerial
                        photography with a drone.
                        <br> <br>
